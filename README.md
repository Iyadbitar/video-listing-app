### Running The Application
To run the application please do the following

1. install and run mongoDB locally
2. Clone the repo
3. In your terminal change directory to the app folder
4. "npm run db:setup" will import the DB and setup a test admin user
5. "npm run webpack" will build the front-end app
6. "npm run server" will start the server

The app will run on http://localhost:4200/


### Important Notes
I have taken too many short cuts and compromises in the code just to provide a functional app with the time I'm able to give to this task sorry for that.
like I skipped unit test, I'm saving the password in clear text and I implement a very loose security model and some code redundancy I know all my faults it just the shortage of time

### Thank you
